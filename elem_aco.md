# Elementary Acoustics
Acoustics - the study of sound & waves. This study enables us to understand how we communicate each other how sound waves are used in various fields like medicine, deep sea exploration, defense  and others. Now a dya operation theater, malls, medical labs and schools are prevented with sound absorbing technology to prevent from outside noise.

In "*Elementary Acoustics*" the word elementary refers the basic or fundamental things of sound. By learizing the equations reveals it's main feature which is wave in nature. Propagation of wave is the first phenomenon encountered in acoustics and their subsets are it's refraction, reflection and diffraction.
## Linearization for lossless homogeneous steady simple fluid
The conservation equation for general fluid are<br>
* Continuous equation (Mass conservation) <br>
$\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \vec{\upsilon}) =0$ <br>
* Momentum Conservation (Euler Equation)<br>
$\rho(\frac{\partial \vec{\upsilon}}{\partial t}+\vec{\upsilon} \cdot \nabla \vec{\upsilon})+ \nabla p= \nabla \cdot \tau + \vec{F}$<br>
* Energy Conservation (Entropy Equation)<br>
$T\rho(\frac{\partial s}{\partial t}+\vec{\upsilon}\cdot \nabla s)= \tau : D - \nabla\cdot \vec{q}+r$<br>

where: 
 * $\rho$ is fluid density
 * $\vec{\upsilon}$ is fluid vector
 * $\tau = \sigma + pI$ is viscosity tensor
 * $D = \frac{1}{2} (\nabla \vec{\upsilon}+^\Tau\nabla\vec{\upsilon})$ is strain rate tensor.

 ### Conservation equation
 It describe conservation of mass, momentum and energy.
